    <h3>
        Reduce Activity in Loops
    </h3>

    <p>Loops are often used in programming. Each statement
    in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for
    each iteration of the loop.  Statements or assignments
    that can be placed outside of the loop will make the
    loop run faster.</p>

    <h4>Bad Code:</h4>
    <p>var i;</p>
    <p>for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {</p>

    <h4>Better Code:</h4>
    <p>var i;</p>
    <p>var l = arr.length;</p>
    <p>for (i = 0; i < l; i++) {</p>

    <p>The Bad code accesses the length property of an array
    each time the loop is iterated. The better code accesses
    the property outside the loop and makes the loop run
    faster.</p>

    <h3>Reduce DOM Access</h3>

    <p>Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other
    JavaScript statements.  If you expect to access a DOM element
    several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:</p>

    <p id="performDemo01"></p>

    <script>
        var obj;
        obj = document.getElementById("performDemo01");
        obj.innerHTML = " HELLO ";
    </script>

</div>
