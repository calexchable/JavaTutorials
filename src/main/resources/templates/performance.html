    <h3>
        Reduce Activity in Loops
    </h3>

    <p>Loops are often used in programming. Each statement
    in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for
    each iteration of the loop.  Statements or assignments
    that can be placed outside of the loop will make the
    loop run faster.</p>

    <h4>Bad Code:</h4>
    <p>var i;</p>
    <p>for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {</p>

    <h4>Better Code:</h4>
    <p>var i;</p>
    <p>var l = arr.length;</p>
    <p>for (i = 0; i < l; i++) {</p>

    <p>The Bad code accesses the length property of an array
    each time the loop is iterated. The better code accesses
    the property outside the loop and makes the loop run
    faster.</p>
</div>

    <h3>Reduce DOM Access</h3>

    <p>Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other
    JavaScript statements.  If you expect to access a DOM element
    several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:</p>

    <p id="performDemo01"></p>

    <p>Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small.  This
    will always improve page loading, and speed up rendering (page
    display), especially on smaller devices.  Every attempt to
    search the DOM (like getElementsByTagName) will benefit from
    a smaller DOM.</p>

    <script>
        var obj;
        obj = document.getElementById("performDemo01");
        obj.innerHTML = " HELLO ";
    </script>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Avoid Unnecessary Variables</h3>

    <p>Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save
        values. Often you can replace code</p>
    <p><strong>like this:</strong></p>

    <p>var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;</p>
    <p>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;</p>

    <p><strong>with this:</strong></p>

    <p>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    first Name + " " + lastName;</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Delay JavaScript Loading</h3>

    <p>Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets
    the browser load the page first. While a script is
    downloading, the browser will not start any other
    downloads.  In addition, all parsing and rendering activity
    might be blocked.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Avoid Using with</h3>

    <p>Avoid using the with keyword. It has a negative effect
    on speed. It also clutters up JavaScript scopes.</p>

    <p>The with Keyword is <strong>not allowed</strong> in
    strict mode.</p>
