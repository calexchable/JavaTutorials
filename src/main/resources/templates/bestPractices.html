<h1>Java Script - Best Practices</h1>
<p>from w3schools.com</p>

<h3>Avoid Global Variables</h3>

<p>Minimize the use of global variables. This
includes all data types, objects, and functions.
Global variables and functions can be overwritten
by other scripts.</p>

<h3>Always Declare Local Variables</h3>

<p>All variables used in a function should be
declared as local variables. Local variables must
be declared with the var keyword or the let keyword,
otherwise they will become global variables.</p>

<h4>Declarations on Top</h4>

<p>It is good coding practice to pull all
declarations at the top of each script or function.
This provides cleaner code, a single place to look
for local variables, makes it easier to avoid unwanted
or implied global variables, reduces the possibility
of unwanted re-declarations.</p>

<h3>Initialize Variables</h3>

<p>It is a good coding practice to initialize
variables when you declare them.</p>

<h3>Never Declare Number, String, or Boolean
Objects</h3>

<p>Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as
primitive values. Not as objects. Declaring these
types as objects, slows down execution speed, and
produces nasty side effects.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Never create strings as objects.</p>
<p>Strings and objects cannot safely be compared.</p>

<p id="bestPracDemo01"></p>

<script>
    var x = "John";
    var y = new String("John");

    document.getElementById("bestPracDemo01").innerHTML =
        x === y;
</script>
